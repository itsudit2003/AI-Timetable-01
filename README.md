# 📅 AI Timetable Generator (Powered by Google's GenAI)

A smart AI-based timetable generation system that creates optimized class schedules by considering subject load, teacher availability, time constraints, and conflict prevention — all powered by **Google Generative AI**. We developed this project mainly as a submission for our Final Year Project (MCA, 2025).
