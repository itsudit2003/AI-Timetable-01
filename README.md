# 📅 AI Timetable Generator (Powered by Gemini AI)

A smart AI-based timetable generation system that creates optimized class schedules by considering subject load, teacher availability, time constraints, and conflict prevention — all powered by **Google Gemini AI**. We developed this project mainly as a submission for our Final Year Project (MCA, 2025).

This project solves that using AI:

- ✔️ Automatically allocates subjects based on rules  
- ✔️ Balances workload across the week  
- ✔️ Generates clean, ready-to-use timetable formats
